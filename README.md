# Movie Library

A modern, responsive web application for browsing and managing movies built with R## Implementation Details

### Key Technical Enhancements
1. **Type Safety**
   - Implemented full TypeScript support
   - Created comprehensive type definitions for TMDB API responses
   - Added proper error handling with type checking

2. **State Management**
   - Used React Query for efficient API data management

   - Added proper caching and invalidation strategies

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented infinite scrolling for better load times
   - Added debounced search to minimize API calls
   - Optimized component re-renders

### Design Choices & Assumptionsact, TypeScript, and Vite. The application uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch movie data and provides features for searching, filtering, and managing a personal watchlist.

## Core Requirements
‚úÖ Fetch and display popular movies using TMDB API

## Enhanced Features
I've extended the core requirements with the following additional features:

1. **Advanced Movie Browsing**
   - üé¨ Infinite scrolling for seamless movie exploration
   - üîç Real-time search suggestions as you type
   - ÔøΩ Fixed header navigation that stays visible while scrolling

2. **Enhanced Filtering System**

     Language: [English]
     ```
   - ‚≠ê TMDB rating and vote count
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Movie runtime
   - üé¨ Release status (In Theaters, Coming Soon, etc.)
   - üì∫ Streaming availability information

4. **Enhanced Watchlist Features**
   - ÔøΩ Real-time watchlist counter in navigation
   - üíæ Persistent storage using localStorage
   - üîÑ Quick add/remove functionality from any view

   - üì± Fully responsive design for all screen sizes
   - ÔøΩ Color-coded badges for better visual categorization:
     - Teal: Genres
     - Purple: Country
     - Blue: Language
   - üñºÔ∏è Image fallbacks for missing posters
   - üí´ Smooth animations and transitions

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ‚ö° Debounced search to prevent API spam
   - üì¶ Efficient caching with React Query
   - üîÑ Optimized re-rendering with React hooks
